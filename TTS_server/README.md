`TTS_server.rb` is a simple Ruby script to allow Station Manager (or conceievably other applications, particularly dockerized ones) to make requests for audio files generated by Text-To-Speech from provided text. TTS_server takes requests by HTTP endpoint, so that docker containers can reliably make the request out to the host, and it provides a response by a path to the output file which the requesting client must have local access to.

TTS_server was created the way it was to allow use of MacOS's excellent commandline-available voice synthesis, which poses two problems:

- MacOS's voice synthesis itself cannot be dockerized
- Directly calling out to a MacOS host from a docker container running there is not possible using named pipes or UNIX domain sockets, due to how docker containers are virtualized on Mac

More documentation on configuration and usage can be found in the wiki.
