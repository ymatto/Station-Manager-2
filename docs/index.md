### What *is* this jive?

Station Manager 2 is a system using [Liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) and [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) that makes it easy to set up and operate **fully automated netradio stations**.

SM2 is server software, but is designed to let you focus on your netradio station's programming, rather than lots of system setup and programming. Using Docker, deploying your first netradio station is as simple as cloning the Station Manager 2 repo and running...

```console
docker compose up -d
```

With the basics taken care of for you, you can **customize** your netradio station by just editing a few JSON config files, and providing **your own playlists of music**.

SM2 is fully **free and open source** under the MIT license. Enjoy!

### Solid. What all can it do?

**SM2 lays a load of *groovy options* on you, such as:**
* Create shows from your music playlists of MP3 and other files
* Define a 24/7 schedule of shows for your "DJs" to play
* Automated DJ announcements using text-to-speech (currently Mac hosts only) or pre-recorded audio
* Run multiple netradio streams simultaneously
* Choose the bitrate of your streams
* Telnet server to tell your DJ what to do *just like a real station manager*

### Who is this doing this synthetic type of *alpha beta psychedelic funkin'*?

SM2 is [something I do](https://www.hine.org) in my free time for fun, and thought others might enjoy using it too. Why? Good ole fashioned FM-style netradio, with playlists hand-curated by lovers of music, can offer some things that algorithmic Spotify feeds can't.
