### What *is* this jive?

Station Manager 2 is a system using [Liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) and [Icecast](https://icecast.org/) that makes it easy to set up and operate **fully automated netradio stations**.

Using Docker, deploying your first netradio station is as simple as cloning Station Manager 2 and running...
```console
docker compose up -d
```

With the basics taken care of for you, you can **customize** your netradio station by just editing a few JSON config files, and providing **your own playlists of music**.

### Solid. What all can it do?

**SM2 lays a load of *groovy options* on you, such as:**
* Create shows from your music playlists of MP3 and other files
* Define a 24/7 schedule of shows for your "DJs" to play
* Automated DJ announcements using text-to-speech (currently Mac hosts only) or pre-recorded audio
* Run multiple netradio streams simultaneously
* Choose the bitrate of your streams
* Telnet server to tell your DJ what to do *just like a real station manager*

### Who is this doing this synthetic type of *alpha beta psychedelic funkin'*?

SM2 is [something I do](https://www.hine.org) in my free time for fun, and thought others might enjoy using it too. 

Good ole fashioned FM-style netradio, playing music hand-curated by lovers of music, can offer some things that algorithmic Spotify feeds can't.

SM2 is fully **free and open source** using the MIT license. Enjoy!
