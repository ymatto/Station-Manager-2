This folder is a bit of a dustbin for `.liq` files used to prove out certain things before integrating into Station Manager proper. Mostly it's just for me.

Nothing in here is guaranteed to work (or be particularly useful) but they might be worth a look if you want to play around with Liquidsoap basics.

Generally stuff here is intended to be moved up into the `example` folder to run, where I've got other expected stuff like an icecast.xml, music folder, etc.
